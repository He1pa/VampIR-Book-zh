# Public Witnesses


By default, all witnesses generated by Vamp-IR are private. If one wants to make a variable public, they may mark such a variable explicitly using the `pub` keyword. Take the following file, for example;

```haskell
pub x;

x = 1;
```

Up front, we declare the variable, `x`, to be public. If we compile the proof, during solicitation, we will see;

```bash
> * Soliciting circuit witnesses...
> ** x[5] (public): 
```

stating that the variable is, in fact, public. If one enters `1` here, during proving they will see;

```bash
> * Reading public parameters...
> * Public inputs:
> x[5] = Fp256 "(00[...]001)"
> * Verifying proof validity...
> * Zero-knowledge proof is valid
```

So the public inputs are shown explicitly.

Public inputs *must* be put at the start of a file. If one tries the following file;

```haskell
x = 1;

pub x;
```

they will get a parsing error during circuit compilation.

Multiple public variables can be declared at once using `,`, and multiple `pub` declarations can be made so long as they're at the beginning of the file.

```haskell
pub x, y, z;
pub h;

x ^ 2 + y = z;
h = z + 1;
```

There is not currently a way to automatically assign public values; they must be solicited.
